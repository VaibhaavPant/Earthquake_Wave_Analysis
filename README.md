# Earthquake_Wave_Analysis_using_FFT_algorithm
Project made by Vaibhav Pant and his teammates (Prashant Rawat, Shivani Jugran,Siddhart Chakraborty) during their 4th semester in 2025
This project tend to make the analysis of the earthquake in graphical representation of signals. so seismologists can study about them. It analyze the data guven on the base of Frequency and time.
We have used FFT O(nlogn) time complexity
Langauges used- Python
Libraries used- Numpy, Matplotlib, Pandas
